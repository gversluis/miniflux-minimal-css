# miniflux-minimal

## Introduction
I wrote a black Miniflux custom CSS for a more minimal interface.

It basically:
- Adds a fixed menu bar at the top because I wanted feeds available within a single click
- Removes text where there are icons available because I wanted a more compact design
- Added some colors for the icons to make them visually distinctable
- Moved common item actions to the right where they are close to my fingers on mobile
- Hides less common actions which are available one click away (access keys may still work)
- Black background so it produces less light and uses less battery


This CSS was written for [Miniflux v2](https://github.com/miniflux/v2) version 2.0.41 and may work on different versions.

I wrote this CSS for my own use so it is not tested except for my current Mull on Android and Firefox on Windows.
